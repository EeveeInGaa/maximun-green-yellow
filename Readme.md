# A crazy color ..

**why do I do this?**
this is a little single-page application to learn new css stuff and stay trained in it.

furthermore I create mockups in figma to learn how to use it and try to implement this style in code with css.

I work on this when I find the time and want to try new stuff.

(another attendee of the bootcamp gave me this idea, thank you [Chirstian](https://github.com/ChristianMLux)!)

_new stuff for me:_

- word rotator

_need to add:_

- responsive design
- arrows
- center everything

_need to fix:_

- word rotator
- footer

_what to come?_

- more colors that get special attention (in same style)
- a colorpicker that shows the hexcode in this style
